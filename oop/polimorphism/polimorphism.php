/**
 * Generally, Polymorphism is of two types: compile-time (overloading) and run time (overriding), but polymorphism in PHP does not support overloading, or in other words, compile-time polymorphism. The most significant benefit of polymorphism in PHP is that you don’t have to worry about the technicalities of defining which code is written in which class, as all will be used in the same way.
 * 
 * Polymorphism in PHP can be implemented by either the use of interfaces or abstract classes. 
 * 
 * Constant declared in a Inteface cannot be ovverridden but constant declared in a parent class can be ovverride within the child class.
